📊 End-to-End Data Analytics and Visualization

This project demonstrates an end-to-end data analytics workflow combining Python-based exploratory data analysis (EDA) and interactive Power BI visualizations to extract actionable insights from raw data.

The analysis was performed using a Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) with Pandas and NumPy for data cleaning, preprocessing, and transformation. Matplotlib and Seaborn were used to answer 5+ analytical questions through statistical analysis and visual trend exploration.

To complement the programmatic analysis, an interactive Power BI dashboard was developed to address 10 key analytical questions using KPIs, slicers, and dynamic visuals. The dashboard also incorporates geo-spatial map visualizations to uncover regional and location-based patterns and support data-driven decision-making.

This project highlights the complete pipeline from raw data to insights, showcasing skills in data analysis, visualization, and storytelling.
